      "a": "Pacta requires:\n- webbrowser\n- [the Metamask extension](https://metamask.io/)\n- some [Ether on the account](https://bity.com/en/)\n\nPacta is a web app which runs on all modern browsers both desktop and mobile. To access the Ethereum blockchain, you require a web3js compatible tool. For most users, the easiest way is to use the browser extension Metamask."
    },
    "2": {
      "q": "Can I use an existing association on Pacta?",
      "a": "Yes. Please consider what functionality you want to run on Pacta and what you want to do in the «traditional world»."
    },
    "3": {
      "q": "Can I use an banking account for my association?",
      "a": "Yes.  However, everthing you do off-chain (outside Pacta) is not secured by the blockchain."
    },
    "4": {
      "q": "Why Pacta, why blockchain?",
      "a": "The blockchain is a secure, immutable database. It allows Pacta to implement the logic of an association in smart contracts. Your association is created in the blockchain and exists independent of Pacta. Pacta is your easy way to the blockchain."
    },
    "5": {
      "q": "What currencies does Pacta support?",
      "a": "Pacta runs on Ethereum blockchain which is powered by Ether."
    },
    "6": {
      "q": "Do I need Ether to run Pacta?",
      "a": "Yes. Each change in the blockchain is executed world wide and requres a small fee, named «gas». The easiest way to get Ether is using a Broker (such as [Bity](https://bity.com/en/))."
    },
    "7": {
      "q": "What is gas and why do I need to pay it?",
      "a": "Each change in the blockchain is executed world wide and requres a small fee, named «gas»."
    },
    "8": {
      "q": "How much does it cost to use Pacta?",
      "a": "The gas required for the blockchain, plus 1% of each payment to the association as small fee to run Pacta."
    },
    "9": {
      "q": "How much does it cost to found an association?",
      "a": "Pacta does not charge an initial fee beside your association's subscription fee you select. However, the usage of Ethereum blockchain requires gas. You will see the exact amount of gas costs before founding."
    },
    "10": {
      "q": "I need a function XYZ. When will it be available?",
      "a": "Please let us know your wishes. We try to implement frequently requested functions as quickly as possible. However, there are challenges in the blockchain world that cannot yet be solved and implemented with the necessary security. We will keep you up to date."
    },
    "11": {
      "q": "Does Pacta support any organizational forms other than associations?",
      "a": "Currently not. We are working on it."
    },
    "12": {
      "q": "What's up with the name Pacta?",
      "a": "There is a latin saying «pacta sunt servanda» - «agreements must be kept». This is our motto."
    },
    "13": {
      "q": "Is everything public?",
      "a": "The Ethereum blockchain is a public database with full transparency. That is why we recommend *not* to store confidential information on the blockchain but instead use another tool for that. We are currently working on solutions to ensure privacy."
    },
    "14": {
      "q": "Why does it take a while until an transaction is confirmed?",
      "a": "When you do a transaction (such as founding an association, joining etc.) data is directly written to the blockchain. Since the blockchain is not a single database but needs confirmation from various participants, it takes some seconds until the transaction is confirmed."
